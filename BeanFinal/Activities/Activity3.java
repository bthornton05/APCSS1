    /*Farmer Jebadiah Jonah Jahovius the seventh has 25 acres of land upon which he wants to plant soybeans. Assuming a 
    row width of 15 inches, an average crop emergence of 80 percent per foot of seedlings, and an average planting of 5 
    seeds per foot, write a boolean expression to check if 4,000,000 seeds are enough to plant Jebadiah's field. Additionally, 
    Jebadiah wants to know if his fields can yield 3,000 bushels of Soybeans. Write a boolean expression to check if his fields 
    will return this yield. Keep in mind, a bushel is 60 pounds of soybeans, and on average, a soybean plant produces around 75 
    pods per plant with an average of 3 seeds per pod with each seed weighing .00529 ounces. Write any variables as needed. */
