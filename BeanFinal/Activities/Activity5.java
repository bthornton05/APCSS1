    /* Farmer John Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemubwem Ossas has managed to produce a sizeable 8,000 bushels of
     * soybeans this year. Farmer John wants to keep about 2 percent of his seedlings for germination the next year, so he wants
     * an estimate of how much he can sell the rest of the beans for. This year, a bushel of soy beans sells for $14.32 with Farmer
     * John receiving about 12% of the profit. In order to improve his harvesting time the next year, Farmer John wants to purchase 
     * a new combine. John can either buy combine A, an amazing 2022 John Deere X9 1100 costing $1,043,978, and a less amazing
     * but still capable combine B, being a 2019 John Deere S780 costing $379,900. Assuming Farmer John applies for a 5 year Farm 
     * Storage Facility Loan with a down payment of 1.875%, write a boolean expression to check what combine, if any, Farmer John 
     * can afford. */
