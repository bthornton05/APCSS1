Dearest Ninja,                                    Monday, December 9, 2019

           Since I am such an incredible individual I don't play Fortnite, but this book in a whole was a beautiful tale of hardships, love, loss, and happiness. It helped me to achieve a greater sense of purpose in life, and made me realize my true potential as a human-being. This book stands the testaments of time, the rough waters, and tribulations of war. This book easily nears or meets biblical levels in a new never seen or heard before way. The words plastered vividly on the page open my brain to accepting new ideas, and knowledge that I could have never mustered the faith to learn before. And now the book sits before on its pedestal of hope ready to be read again and past on through generations.

   Humblest regards,
